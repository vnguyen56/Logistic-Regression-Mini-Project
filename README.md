# Logistic-Regression-Mini-Project
We turn our attention to classification. Classification tries to predict, which of a small set of classes, an observation belongs to. Mathematically, the aim is to find  y , a label based on knowing a feature vector  x . For instance, consider predicting gender from seeing a person's face, something we do fairly well as humans. To have a machine do this well, we would typically feed the machine a bunch of images of people which have been labelled "male" or "female" (the training set), and have it learn the gender of the person in the image from the labels and the features used to determine gender. Then, given a new photo, the trained algorithm returns us the gender of the person in the photo.
